When you start to play the game it will automaticlaly start the game and a button will flash
once it flashes the screen will prompt you to select the button that was just flashed. once you have done so
the program will pick up and repeat the previously shown button(s) and then add another button to the sequence.
once this has been donea and shown to the user they will then be able to select the buttons
in the order they were shown. This is the game. The game will continue to add buttons to the sequence
until the user fails to select the correct button in the sequence. Once the user fails to select the correct button
in order the game will end and leave the user with the you lost screen. PSA: the game is a lil buggy and the
flashes may go fast so be prepared once the the button has been pressed.
